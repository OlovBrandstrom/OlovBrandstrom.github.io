## About Me

I hold **dual** M.Sc. degrees in **Engineering Physics** and **Computer Science & Engineering**.  
During my studies, I also worked as a teaching assistant in mathematics at university level.  
Over the years, I have gained experience from both small startups and large corporations, giving me a broad perspective on how technology can be developed and applied in different contexts.  

What excites me most is working at the intersection of **mathematics and programming**â€”tackling problems where analytical thinking, algorithms, and creative implementation come together. I am especially passionate about projects where complex models or simulations lead to tangible, visual, or interactive results.

## 3D Graphics (PC)

I develop my own PC graphics engine from scratch, building on libraries such as **GLEW, OpenGL Mathematics (GLM), stb_image, PhysX, and ImGui**.  
This engine serves as a playground for exploring rendering techniques, physics simulation, and interactive interfaces. It allows me to experiment with both the low-level details of computer graphics and the higher-level design of real-time 3D applications.  
The demos are running on an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060.

## 3D Graphics (Android, 2010)

These are some of my earlier projects, developed for Android phones around 2010.  
While the graphics engine itself was created by others, I was responsible for designing and implementing all **3D animations** as well as writing the **shaders**.  
Despite the hardware limitations of the time, these projects gave me valuable experience in real-time graphics and creative problem solving on constrained devices.

## Games with AI

As a way to explore algorithms and decision-making, I developed a few classic board and memory games in **C#**.  
Each project includes its own AI opponent, designed with different strategies ranging from heuristic control to optimal play.

- **Othello / Reversi**  
  The AI focuses on reducing the opponentâ€™s options, aiming to control key positions on the board and eventually secure the corners and edges.

- **Quarto**  
  The AI begins by ensuring it does not lose quickly, and then transitions into solving the game once eight pieces remain.

- **Memory**  
  This AI is game-theory optimal, implemented using **dynamic programming**.  
  I also wrote a [short paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xm-Q24D9QQ3tyl5iO2p9QlzYYyfwPauC/view?usp=sharing) with observations of the solution.  
  For example, sometimes it is best for *both* players to only flip already known cards. Counterintuitively, in some situations, the player who risks searching for new pairs is more likely to lose.

## Music

In addition to my technical work, I also compose and produce music.  
For me, music is another way of exploring patterns, structure, and creativity.  
Below are some selected pieces that showcase my personal style and interests.
